    <h5>Robot Design Idea</h5>
  <body>
    <p>
      Fall of 2015 I took an arch elective, Architectural Robotics, we learned how to
      program with and Arduino and we had to design a robot with certain qualities that
      make an, otherwise dead space, more interesting. For my idea I wanted to design
      a robot that would follow an individual around with a motion sensor.

    <figure role="img" aria-labelledby="robotone">
      <img src="robotone.jpg" alt="Step one of the design" />
      <figcaption id="robotone">
        The robot would be placed in a space that normally does not get too much activity.
    </figure>
    <figure role="img" aria-labelledby="robottwo">
      <img src="robottwo.jpg" alt="Step one of the design" />
      <figcaption id="robottwo">
        When one notices the robot sitting in the space one would approach it.
    </figure>
    <figure role="img" aria-labelledby="robotthree">
      <img src="robotthree.jpg" alt="Step one of the design" />
      <figcaption id="robotthree">
        When one gets close enough to the robot the robot will sense their presence.
    </figure>
    <figure role="img" aria-labelledby="robotfour">
      <img src="robotfour.jpg" alt="Step one of the design" />
      <figcaption id="robotfour">
        The robot will then start to follow the individual around the space.
